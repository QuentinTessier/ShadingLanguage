This project is a dive into compilation in a C like language and not Haskell.
I intend to make a simple shading language compile to SPIRV, the goal would be to support vertex and fragment shaders.

I also looked into parser combinators and create a library that can create left recursive parser, I've wrote more about it in [this ReadMe](./src/ParserCombinator/README.md)
